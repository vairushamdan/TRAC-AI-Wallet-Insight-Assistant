# 🧬 TRAC AI Wallet Insight Assistant

> An AI-powered on-chain behavior analysis tool built on **Trac Network / Intercom** stack.

**Live App:** [`index.html`](./index.html)

---

## 🔍 What Is This?

TRAC AI Wallet Insight Assistant is more than a balance checker — it's a **behavioral intelligence layer** for TRAC/TAP wallets on Bitcoin.

Users can ask:
- *"Analyze my wallet activity"*
- *"Am I holding or trading too much?"*
- *"What is my risk profile?"*
- *"How am I spending my TRAC?"*

The AI will:
- ✅ Classify wallet type (Active Trader / Long-Term Holder / Whale / Dormant)
- ✅ Analyze transaction frequency & direction ratios
- ✅ Detect behavioral patterns over time
- ✅ Generate a natural-language insight report
- ✅ Answer follow-up questions via conversational chat

**Example AI response:**
> *"You made 18 outgoing transactions this month. Your 72% outgoing ratio classifies you as an Active Trader rather than a long-term holder. Consider batching transfers to reduce network costs."*
